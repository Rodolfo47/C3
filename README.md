# The *Laccaria trichodermophora* comparative genomics

This is the repository of the paper:

*Ángeles-Argáiz et al.* in prep: **The CAZymes and effector peptides of the accessory genome of *Laccaria trichodermophora* explain its differential symbiotic performance.** For *Microbial Genomics* (IF = 5.5) 

### **Aims and scope:**

In order to identify the effect of intraspecific genome variability on the symbiotic capabilities of four *lab-managed* strains, tested as ectomycorrhizal pine inocula, we predict and annotate functional genetic features and clustering genes in orthogroups from the core- and pan-genome. We found the absence of important CAZymes involved in the ectomycorrhize development and low number of effector peptides in strains with poor symbiotic capabilities.

### **Work flow:**

1. Annotation
2. Orthology
3. CAZyme prediction
4. SSP prediction

All computational protocols were made in the Chichen and Bonampak servers and in the Kayab cluster from Centro de Ciencias Genómicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (CCG,UNAM).

All scripts must be run from `~/C3/bin/` dir.
